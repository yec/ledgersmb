This set of files is just for initial testing and proof of concept purposes.
They will be moved out of here into appropriate upgrade scripts as necessary 
and are intended only for collaborative development purposes.

For people trying to get 1.3 up and running manually, the following load order 
should work.  Note that many of these scripts declare types, so if you want to
redefine functions, you will need to drop the types and reload the scripts.

The load order for the files is documented in sql/modules/LOADORDER

Note that the Roles.sql is special and must be preprocessed to get it to work.
A command like:
sed -e 's/<?lsmb dbname ?>/[dbname]/g' Roles.sql > [dbname]_roles.sql 
would work where [dbname] represents the name of the database you are 
installing into.

Also Roles.sql MUST be run last because portions of it depend on function 
declarations in the other scripts.
