=item $eoy->checkpoint_only();

This creates account checkpoints at $eoy->{end_date}.  This has two uses:
1)  Can be used to "close" books without zeroing income/expense accounts.  This
prevents data from being inserted for earlier dates.

2)  This can be used to improve performance by creating a "lookback" point.

=cut

sub checkpoint_only {
    my ($self) = @_;
   $self->exec_method(funcname => 'eoy_create_checkpoint');
   $self->{dbh}->commit;
}

=item $eoy->reopen_books()

This reverses any end of year transaction on $eoy->{end_date}, and deletes 
checkpoints for that day.

=cut

sub reopen_books {
    my ($self) = @_;
   $self->exec_method(funcname => 'eoy_reopen_books');
   $self->{dbh}->commit;
}

=item $eoy->close_books()

Requires all properies in BASIC PROPERTIES to be set.  This creates a gl 
yearend transaction, and moves income/expenses to the selected equity account
for retained earnings.

=cut

sub close_books {
    my ($self) = @_;
   $self->exec_method(funcname => 'eoy_close_books');
   $self->{dbh}->commit;
}

=item $eoy->list_earnings_accounts

Returns a list of equity accounts, and sets $eoy->{earnings_accounts} to a 
list of hashrefs.  These are used to select retained earnings accounts in 
closing books.

=cut

sub list_earnings_accounts{
    my ($self) = @_;
    my @results = $self->exec_method(funcname => 'eoy_earnings_accounts');
    $self->{earnings_accounts} = \@results;
    return @results;
}
